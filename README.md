# Cppcheckdata Shims Library

The default Cppcheck API for authoring addons leaves *a lot* to be desired. The representation is too *concrete*. The authors of Cppcheck never imagined an addon could be used for reasons wherein *abstraction* and *constraint* was needed. But now, we establish a very 'tick' layer on top of `cppcheckdata.py`, which parses the XML dumpfiles and provides the aforementioned concrete IR.

This is what we in the business call a 'shim'. Not to be confused with a 'polyfill', that's a whole other can of worms. These are tools for:

- Control flow analysis;
- Data flow analysis;
- Abstract interpretation;
- Symbolic execution;
- Solving the constraints set by the latter two;

And we also give you 'the QScore', which measures how clean and error-free your program is.

Proof is in the pudding, though. Test it for yourself. Documentation is available in `doc` directory. To install this addon, just run:

```sh
$ make && sudo make install
$ make doc
```

Note that, some of the features mentioned in this README file is still being developed. The library might not be sound. This is a WIP project. However, you are free to submit pull requests. **We accept AI-generated pull requests!**.

This library has been funded by Poyan Afzar Sharif. It is licenced under the permissive MIT license. You are free to distribute and modify this software. Though, attribution embiggens the smallest man. A lot of this code, however, is generated by Opus 4.6 and cannot be licences, so whatever.
